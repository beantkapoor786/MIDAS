# DADA2 16S rRNA Analysis Pipeline — Shiny GUI

A modern, dark-themed R Shiny application that walks you through the complete DADA2 pipeline for 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis — from raw FASTQ files to phyloseq visualizations.

## Requirements

- **R** ≥ 4.0
- Internet connection (first run only — for package installation and SILVA database download)

All R packages are installed automatically on first launch:

| Package | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| dada2 | Bioconductor | Core denoising pipeline |
| phyloseq | Bioconductor | Downstream community analysis |
| Biostrings | Bioconductor | DNA sequence handling |
| DECIPHER | Bioconductor | IdTaxa taxonomy assignment (optional method) |
| ggplot2 | CRAN | Plotting |
| tidyverse | CRAN | Data wrangling |
| data.table | CRAN | Fast data manipulation |
| shiny | CRAN | Web application framework |
| shinyjs | CRAN | JavaScript helpers |
| shinyWidgets | CRAN | Enhanced UI widgets |
| DT | CRAN | Interactive tables |
| shinycssloaders | CRAN | Loading spinners |

## How to Launch

1. Click on `Code` in green and then download files using `Download ZIP`.
2. Unzip and open the `app.R` file in Rstudio using the following command.

```r
# From R console:
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

If you don't have the Rstudio, you can directly run it from `Terminal` on Mac using the following command. It should open up in your default browser.

```r
# Or from terminal:
Rscript -e "shiny::runApp('app.R', launch.browser = TRUE)"
```

The app opens in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:XXXX`.

## Pipeline Steps (7-step workflow)

- :bulb: If you’re wondering what happens when you close the browser before the analysis finishes, don’t worry! If you come back the next day, you can simply resume the analysis from the last checkpoint.

### Step 1 — Setup & Files
- Enter the path to your directory of demultiplexed paired-end FASTQ files
- The app auto-detects common forward/reverse naming patterns (e.g., `_R1_001.fastq`) with manual override
- Define sample name extraction: choose a delimiter and element index

### Step 2 — Quality Profiles
- View `plotQualityProfile` for forward and reverse reads
- Use these plots to decide truncation lengths for filtering

### Step 3 — Filter & Trim
- Set `truncLen`, `maxEE`, `truncQ`, `maxN`, `rm.phix` — all editable, tutorial defaults pre-filled
- Filtered files are saved to a `filtered/` subdirectory inside your data path
- View per-sample read retention table

### Step 4 — Learn Errors & Denoise
- Learns error models (`learnErrors`) for forward and reverse reads
- Runs core DADA2 sample inference (`dada`)
- Visualize error rate plots as sanity check
- Multithread auto-detected (enabled on Mac/Linux, disabled on Windows)

### Step 5 — Merge & Chimera Removal
- Merges paired reads (`mergePairs`)
- Constructs ASV sequence table (`makeSequenceTable`)
- Removes chimeras (`removeBimeraDenovo`)
- Shows sequence length distribution, read tracking table, and tracking line plot

### Step 6 — Taxonomy Assignment
- Downloads the SILVA v138.1 database automatically (stored locally for reuse)
- Choose between **assignTaxonomy** (Naive Bayesian) or **IdTaxa** (DECIPHER)
- Optional species-level assignment via `addSpecies`
- For IdTaxa: place `SILVA_SSU_r138_2024.RData` in the database directory

### Step 7 — Phyloseq & Export
- Optionally upload sample metadata (CSV or TSV, first column = sample names as row names)
- Builds a phyloseq object with ASV table, taxonomy, and metadata
- Visualizations: Alpha Diversity (Shannon/Simpson), NMDS Ordination (Bray-Curtis), Taxonomic Bar Plots
- Download all results: ASV table (CSV), taxonomy (CSV), read tracking (CSV), full R workspace (.RData)

## Input Data Requirements

Your FASTQ files must be:
1. **Demultiplexed** — one file per sample per direction
2. **Primers/adapters removed** — no non-biological nucleotides
3. **Matched order** — forward and reverse files correspond to same samples

Supported extensions: `.fastq`, `.fastq.gz`, `.fq`, `.fq.gz`

## Notes

- First run takes longer due to package installation and database downloads
- Subsequent runs load packages instantly — no reinstallation
- The SILVA database (~130 MB) is downloaded once to your specified directory
- All plots use a dark theme matching the application UI
